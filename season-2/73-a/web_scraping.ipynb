        "Typically, when you are writing something that's technical, you want a headline that's *appealing*. This will help you to reach a wider audience and let your work have more visibility and impact as well. The headline or topics of your tutorial should include a short title (typically 10~15 maximum words). The title can include the technology and technique you are talking about, combined with a nice action verb that appeals to a wider audience. For instance, I titled one of my [articles](https://medium.com/dair-ai/building-rnns-is-fun-with-pytorch-and-google-colab-3903ea9a3a79) as follows: \"Building RNNs is Fun with PyTorch and Google Colab\". You can get pretty creative with the headline, but keep in mind that this is the face of your article and it should be given plenty of tinkering before you finalize it. "

        "One of the things I have learned over the years is that everything in data science is better understood with examples, rather than just using plain code or pictures. Before you begin training your models make sure to explain to the reader what the model is expecting as input and what it is expected to output. Rendering code here with nice descriptions help to prepare the reader on what to expect during training the model, especially since the training code is usually longer than most sections of the tutorial. With libraries like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [DyNet](http://dynet.io/) this is fairly easy since they are dynamic computing libraries. TensorFlow also offers an [eager](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager) execution command, `tf.enable_eager_execution()` to evaluate operations immediately. This is what's called imperative programming and I am glad they have it. It makes it easy to teach others about the beautiful things these tools are able to accomplish. I like to think that data science is about storytelling and discovery, and it should remain that way. Clear writing helps!"

In my experience, most data computing libraries use similar training strategies, thus the training structure has become ubiquitous in some sense. If there is still any clarification in your training that you need the reader to know, you can always explain it beforehand. "
